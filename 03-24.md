## Problem
We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters).

So given a string "super", we should return a list of [2, 4].

Some examples:
Mmmm  => []
Super => [2,4]
Apple => [1,5]
YoMama -> [1,2,4,6]
NOTE: Vowels in this context refers to English Language Vowels - a e i o u y

NOTE: this is indexed from [1..n] (not zero indexed!)

## Solution
```python
def vowel_indices(word):
    return [index+1 for index,w in enumerate(word) if w.lower() in list('aeiouy')]
```

## Problem
Write a function that takes a list (in Python) or array (in other languages) of numbers, and makes a copy.

Note that you may have troubles if you do not return an actual copy, item by item, not just a pointer or an alias for an existing list or array.

If not list or array is given as a parameter, the function should raise an error.

Examples:

t = [1,2,3,4]
t_copy = copy_list(t)
t[1] += 5
t == [1,7,3,4]
t_copy = [1,2,3,4]

## Solution
```python
def copy_list(l):
  return l[:]
```


## Problem
Sum Array

Write a method sum (sum_array in python) that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. These may be integers or decimals for Ruby and any instance of Num for Haskell. The numbers can also be negative. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

Examples

print sum_array([1 2 3])
> 6
print sum_array([])
> 0
Assumptions

You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.
What We're Testing

We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.

Disclaimer

This is for beginners so we want to test basic loops and math operations. Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

## Solution
def sum_array(a):
    return sum(a)

## Problem
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contains any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false

http://www.codewars.com/kata/55908aad6620c066bc00002a/train/python

## Solution
```python
def xo(s):
    return len([o for o in s.lower() if o=="o"]) == len([x for x in s.lower() if x=="x"])
```


## other Solution
```python
def xo(s):
    s = s.lower()
    return s.count('x') == s.count('o')
```
