## Practice 8
### Instructions
You'll be passed an array of objects - you must sort them in descending order based on the value of an arbitrarily specified property. For example, when sorted by a, this:

[
  {a: 1, b: 3},
  {a: 3, b: 2},
  {a: 2, b: 40},
  {a: 4, b: 12}
]
should return:

[
  {a: 4, b: 12},
  {a: 3, b: 2},
  {a: 2, b: 40},
  {a: 1, b: 3}
]
your function must take the form function sortList (sortBy, list)

The values will always be numbers, and the properties will always exist.

### My Solution

```python
def sort_list(sort_key, l):
  return sorted(l,key=lambda l: l[sort_key], reverse=True)
```

lambda function is fun.


## Practice 9
### Instructions
Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

### My Solution

```python
def array_diff(a, b):
    if len(b) != 0:
        for son_b in b:
            while son_b in a:
                a.remove(son_b)
    return a
```

### Reference Solution
```python
def array_diff(a, b):
    return [x for x in a if x not in b]

def array_diff(a, b):
    return filter(lambda i: i not in b, a)
```


These solutions are clever!
